I will show you how to work with Apache Kafka Streams for building Real Time Data Processing with STOMP over Websocket using Spring Boot and Angular 8. We will see how to build push notifications using Apache Kafka, Spring Boot and Angular 8. We need to provide some basic things that Kafka Streams requires, such as, the cluster information, application id, the topic to consume, Serdes to use, and so on. I will show you how to build the application using both gradle and maven build tools.
